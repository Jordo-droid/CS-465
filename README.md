Architecture

    Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
    Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
    
   --For the frontend, HTML is responsible for the look and feel of the web application. It produces the buttons, handles the layout, and displays the images needed to provide the look of the application. Whereas JavaScript handled a majority of the functionality of the web application. Such as handling views for the site, and making http requests to the server.
   --The reasoning behind using an NoSQL database is complexity. SQL databases cannot work with different data structures at the same time. For this web application, it is crucial that we be able to store varoius different datasets such as login credentials and trip package information.

Functionality

    How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
    Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

   --JSON objects provide a bit of flexibility to a program as these objects can be used by other languages used within the web application. In this application we used JSON for storing 'trip' objects that would then be called for use in functions by other languages, such as Javascript.

Testing

    Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
   
   --To my understanding, methods are the actual actions made by programs. They handles things like adding, removing, and editing different objects within the entire application. Endpoints are the spots, within a full-stack application, where two or more of the languages used in development begin to work with one another. These endpoints are responsible for allowing JSON objects to be used within Javascript methods, for example. With this in mind, the use of endpoints can cause certain security concrens. Using more than one language for a program means you are bringing along all of the inherent security risks of that language.
   
Reflection

    How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
    
   --This course has given me a better understanding of the development process for a full stack application. It provided a deeper understanding of how certain functions within an application may be reworked several times over in order to properly accomodate for necessary changes to the application. The course long project did a great job of showing me how the different languages work with each other within an application, and how module you can make a web applicaiton. I am still struggling with some of the theory behind the actions, but I can understand how the pieces talk to one another.
